## Quick Start

### Option 1: Simple Local Deployment (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LuisSalvadorHeysen/uchicago-exam-scheduler.git
   cd uchicago-exam-scheduler

   open index.html
   
   # Or simply double-click the file in your file manager
   ```

3. That's it! The application is ready to use.

### Option 2: Using a Local Server

For better development experience, you can serve the files using a local server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Using Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have it installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
